There is no big differnce between running code without opitmalization and O0.
We can see that _O1_ is slower than _O0_. I guess it is beacuse like I have said
in zad3a report, due to the fact that program in not too big. It might be also due to
an emphasis _O1_ puts on a better debug experience. It is easy to see that _O3_ is the
fastest level of optimalization. The _Os_ takes the most time. It is becasue of
the fact that it tries to reduce the code size.

We can see that on _O3_ static library is the fastest and on _Os_ shared library
takes the lead.
