We can see that copying blocks of characters is significantly faster than copying 
character by character. This is because reading one character requires an input/output 
(I/O) operation on the hard disk, which is time-consuming. In the case of reading larger blocks,
the operating system can perform a single I/O operation and read multiple characters at once, 
which speeds up the copying process.
