We can observe a few differences between the wc command and the program's output. 
The wc command displays the sizes of all files and directories, 
including those that the program skips. In contrast, the program skips 
directories and hidden files or files for which it cannot obtain information using 
the stat() function.

Additionally, we may notice a difference in the size of the resulting output file 
because the program overwrites the file, which results in a larger file size.

To run a test type: make test
