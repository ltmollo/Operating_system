We can see that files created with a program and by using
tr function are identical so that means that the program works.
 
We can see that using sys functions like write and read
is faster than using lib functions such as fwrite and fread
probably because they are operating directly on file descriptors, 
rather than on file streams as with the library functions.
However the difference is small or negligible.

To run a test type: make test
